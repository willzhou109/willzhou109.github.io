I was presented a volunteer certificate by the MPP for Oakville North and Burlington in 2022. I also trained a group of youth on how to operate the audio-visual and live-streaming systems, as I had to leave for university. I still occasionally return to play piano during church when I come home from university!</p>

                                    <p class="clubdescrip">During the challenging period of COVID-19, I recognized the need for positivity and connection. I founded the Clearview Ensemble, recruited six other musicians, and organized concerts to bring live music to the community. I helped arrange the concert programs, organized rehearsal sessions and played both piano and violin in the concerts. In addition to providing live music, the ensemble seized the opportunity to raise over $1,100 for SickKids and was deemed SickKids Champions in October 2022.
